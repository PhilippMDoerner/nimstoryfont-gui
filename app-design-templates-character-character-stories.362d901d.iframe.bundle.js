This could've allowed them to get to a universe not controlled by... \"this\" universe. A way to escape the cycle of rising and falling civilizations, which the universe squashes before the civilization learns \"too much\".

He does acknowledge that it could've been an honest mistake of Barbatos', who might've truly believed that this was the case.

Seemingly satisfied with that, Murtagh nods to himself.</p>\n<p>After that I ask for why Barbatos isn't just being released back into the hells to have him everywhere but here. The reason is quite self evident. The lamp manages to contain some of his power, leaving him still with a considerable amount of it. The issue is, that he's too powerful now, due to the dark star. To elaborate on that, he tells a bit of a story. There used to be originally a group of protectors, divine beings called \"angels\". The one chief among them, Lucifer, wanted to influence the universe more than just protecting it. He became the first devil and was given \"the compulsion\", an innate desire to fight chaos. Suleman, after capturing the Djinn and the Trine captured Lucifer and... turned him into a staff. When Lucifer fell from his position as an angel and became a devil, he left behind \"the dark star\", a relic now in Barbatos' possession. So it is not like releasing him back would get him forced under the rule of a more powerful archdevil. He would likely be more powerful than some, if not most of them. And with that power would come the ability to act, potentially in revenge against Suleman. Not necessarily enough to overcome the compulsion, but there are ways to leave the tree intact and still destroy everything Suleman ever created. This may not be true for Agari and Lairann, but they are dogmatically loyal to Barbatos and thus would likely work to free Barbatos if released themselves. And weakening them isn't really a possibility.</p>\n<p>At my loudly contemplating that last bit, Rhi keeps squinting harshly at me, but I just shrug it off. If she actually has a problem she'd speak up.</p>\n<p>On Cait's question why one would prefer Ahjuu's lamp over Barbatos', to which Suleman confirms that Barbatos is the most powerful, but they all have their own fields of excellence.

More specifically, he asks what knowledge that could do something like this would seek from the temple.</p>\n<p>That question, for the first time, is strange enough that not even Suleman has a direct answer to it. Fen goes on to reveal that he is aware somebody tried to make an incarnation of <strong>him</strong> as a concept to get access to his... knowledge ability. He assumes the temple of time is their backup plan, now that this failed. Suleman muses that they are trying this on people that almost achieved godhood as those that are gods likely wouldn't be available through this mechanism.</p>\n<p>At that Caitriona hands him the fire-dagger she took from Fen all those months ago. Suleman looks at it for a couple seconds before noting it to be the flame of a dragon, taken from it and carved with runes to simulate ancestral memory. It effectively reaches back in time to find somebody that best embodies the concept that was ripped from the dragon. As no thing can exist twice at once, this also means that the dragon no longer can breathe fire.</p>\n<p>He assumes that if the dragon were exposed to flame it would bring forth a being most aligned with a dragon's fire, aka primordial flame. Which... explains the dead, chained up, adult/ancient dragon Fen mentioned seeing on his trip through Galway, where he also got the daggers from.</p>\n<p>As for the daggers themselves, he notes that mixing in a humanoid's blood would dilute this effect and the draconic heritage, which conjures forth images of Astaroth almost immediately. That's about the time he notices Bedivere who was trying his best to fade into the background. He points out that this conjuring up made the person suddenly gain draconic ancestroy, but not turn they themselves draconic. Cleansing water effects like those in the bath would remove this.</p>\n<p>Suleman also notes that draconic heritage tends to be able to extract feelings and memories also from blood. So if somebody were to, say, create one of these daggers from a dragon that had a vendetta, and the person transforming the dagger cut themselves with had a similar vendetta, that would have a \"much closer and more profound\" effect... of some sorts. That effect likely being that somebody stronger that embodies the concept better would be summoned. Images of Astaroth don't just come to mind at this point, they start rampaging through the territory of other thoughts and slicing them into pieces.</p>",encounterConnections:[{pk:738,encounter:690,encounter_details:{name:"Main Session 53 - Questions about daggers",name_full:"Main Session 53 - Questions about daggers",pk:690},character:83,character_details:{name:"Suleman",name_full:"Wizard of the past - Suleman (†)",pk:83}}],name:"Main Session 53 - Questions about daggers",location:199,location_details:{name:"Hotel California",name_full:"River Styx",pk:199,parent_location_name:"River Styx"},title:"Questions about daggers",creation_datetime:"2021-09-19T14:50:47.493037Z",update_datetime:"2021-09-20T09:39:15.642340Z",diaryentry:73,order_index:80,campaign_details:{name:"Aldrune",pk:1}},{pk:691,description:"<p>At that point Caitriona theorizes about mixing the creature that would be created by blood intermingling and how maybe a blood curse could carry over or not.

Not necessarily Caitriona turning into a beast of blackened blood herself, as that appears to be an honest error and shit happens. But her purposeful swapping of fate and thus intentional messing with things is what <em>really</em> grinds the universe's gears. Which never ends well, as Suleman speaks from experience and reveals he was attacked and mashed into paste by a construct made of gears and anti-magic.</p>\n<p>Cait then theorizes on what would happen if one of these two fates were to end, aka she killed Fillaih as she'd had on her agenda for ages now. Which turns out to depend on the intent of the person doing the killing, according to Fillaih. If the killer wanted to make sure Fillaih's fate was never fulfilled, that would make things worse.
